        [Welcome to the dietary planner
        This website is here to provide a basic understanding of diets, how they affect your body, and how you can incorporate them into your life. Not only do we provide information on just the diets but we also provide information on your body and what is considered to be a healthy medium between dieting and harming your body.
        Necessary information
        Before you start looking through the diets it is important to know some information about your body. For one, how much do you weigh currently and has this changed recently? If there has been a change recently why? Have you just been eating more or have you been overly stressed recently? It is important to know this because if you want to progress then being constantly worn down or stressed will lead to little or no results as your body will slow down its metabolic rate. It is also important to know roughly how many calories you are eating so if you do eat less calories overall you can do so slowly suddenly consuming significantly less calories will make you tired as your body is having to work itself without as much energy, your body will also slow its metabolism further as it will think that there is a problem and it needs to conserve energy.
        Goals
        It is important to set specific goals for yourself so you can measure your progress. If you want to lose weight start small, see where you are currently and then set the goal of losing five pounds instead of twenty. Setting smaller goals like this help us stay focused and progressing but when we set goals that are too big then it is common to become upset that the goal is taking awhile and start cutting out calories at a rate that would be unhealthy.

        [What is the purpose of the dietary planner? 
          
        The purpose of the dietary planner is to yield results based on what you are looking for, whether that be to bulk up, lose weight, or anything in between.
        
        Why am I not seeing results?
        
        Everyone's body is unique there is multiple reasons why you might not see initial results for example keto is a low carb diet and works for most people because generally we consume a lot of carbs however if you are someone who regularly does not have a lot of carbs in your diet there is not going to be much change.
        
        Why am I not gaining weight even though I am eating more?
        
        There are several things that impact a person's metabolic rate but we can classify it into two categories. The first is genetic, some people are just born with faster or slower metabolic rates which can play a role but is not the end all be all. The second category is outside factors such as how active you are in your day to day life, how often you workout along with what kind of workouts you are doing, and your emotional well being.
        Why come to this website over another
        The reason why this website is more reliable compared to others is that we do not have a product that we are trying to sell. All the diets listed are not sponsored either, there is no monetary gain for us so all the information here is because it has been proven to work not because we are being paid to say that. This website is simply a tool to help guide you as stated previously everyone is different so you can make your own changes as needed along your dieting journey.]</h3>
