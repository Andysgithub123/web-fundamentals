            <h1 id = "first_question">What is the purpose of the dietary planner?</h1>
            <p id = "first_response">The purpose of the dietary planner is to yield results based on what you are looking for, whether that be to bulk up, lose weight, or anything in between.</p>
        </div>

        <div id = "two">
            <h1 id = "second_question">Why am I not seeing results?</h1>
            <p id = "second_response">Everyone's body is unique there is multiple reasons why you might not see initial results for example keto is a low carb diet and works for most people because generally we consume a lot of carbs however if you are someone who regularly does not have a lot of carbs in your diet there is not going to be much change.</p>
        </div>

        <div id = "three">
            <h1 id = "third_question">Why am I not gaining weight even though I am eating more?</h1>
            <p id = "third_response">There are several things that impact a person's metabolic rate but we can classify it into two categories. The first is genetic, some people are just born with faster or slower metabolic rates which can play a role but is not the end all be all. The second category is outside factors such as how active you are in your day to day life, how often you workout along with what kind of workouts you are doing, and your emotional well being.</p>

        <div id = "four">
            <h1 id = "fourth_question">Why come to this website over another?</h1>
            <p id = "fourth_response">The reason why this website is more reliable compared to others is that we do not have a product that we are trying to sell. All the diets listed are not sponsored either, there is no monetary gain for us so all the information here is because it has been proven to work not because we are being paid to say that. This website is simply a tool to help guide you as stated previously everyone is different so you can make your own changes as needed along your dieting journey.</p>
