        <div class = "grid-item" id = "keto"><h1>What is a Keto Diet:</h1><p>Ketogenic diets goal is to heavily reduce carbohydrates or completely cut out carbohydrates whilst having a high intake of fats. For Keto diets the fat intake should be around 60-70 percent of your daily meal, if you choose to still have some carbs 5-10 percent should be the makeup of your diet, and that leaves protein taking up around 20-35 percent.</p></div>           
        <div class = "grid-item" id = "keto-foods"><h1>Keto Foods:</h1><p>Meats, Eggs, some types of Cheese, plain Greek Yogurt, vegetables, and nuts and berries</p></div>
        <div class = "grid-item" id = "why-keto"><h1>Why do a Keto diet:</h1><p>There are two reasons as to why you would pick Keto as a diet. For one Keto is mainly used for weight loss so for those that don't care much for their strength and just want to start losing weight Keto tends to work well. The second reason as to why people choose Keto is for having a more lean build since it normally comes with weight loss. That being said, your carb intake before starting Keto also plays a role in the effectiveness; for example if your carb intake is already very low there will not be as much of a difference as to someone that has a high carb diet. Another thing to consider before starting Keto is that since Carbs usually take up a large portion of peoples diets, completely cutting them out/heavily reducing the intake can cause you to get sick.</p></div>

        <div class = "grid-item" id = "protein"><h1>High Protein Diet:</h1><p>High protein diets so exactly what the name suggests having a diet that is higher in protein. A high protein diet starts when your protein intake is about 20% of your diet at the least. Much like Keto, high protein diets restrict carbohydrate intake, but usually do not restrict as heavily as Keto and do not require a very low carb intake but it does tend to work better with lower carb consumption.</p></div>
        <div class = "grid-item" id = "protein-foods"><h1>High Protein Foods:</h1><p>Eggs, Chicken, lean Beef, Fish, Milk, Protein Shakes, Peanut Butter, Protein Bars, and Brown Rice</p></div>
        <div class = "grid-item" id = "why-protein"><h1>Why do a High Protien Diet:</h1><p>The goal of high protein diets is for bulking. This is for people that workout consistently and that want not to lose weight but to gain muscle mass. While losing weight with a high protein diet is possible, that is not the focus of this diet. When considering this diet's outcome, think about people that you see on social media or at the gym that are heavy whilst still being very strong and muscular.</p></div>

        <div class = "grid-item" id = "gluten"><h1>Gluten Free Diet:</h1><p>The gluten free diet is just completely cutting out gluten for your meals.</p></div>
        <div class = "grid-item" id = "gluten-foods"><h1>Gluten Free Foods:</h1><p>fruits and vegetables, nuts, beans, eggs, rice, oats, corn, and potatoes</p></div>
        <div class = "grid-item" id = "why-gluten"><h1>Why do a Gluten Free Diet:</h1><p>Gluten free diets are mainly just for those who have health issues that involve gluten. While this makes up the majority of people who use gluten free diets some other reasons why people like gluten free diets is because a lot of processed foods have gluten cutting out processed foods in itself is fairly popular because they are foods that are know to be very unhealthy such as bread, pizza, pancakes, baked goods, and most desserts. There has been claims that gluten free diets lead to better health, more energy, and weight loss but this has not been adequately researched yet according to the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.</p></div>
